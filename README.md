# Using reinforcement learning to train an autonomous remote control car

This project is heavily reliant on the work done in my other RL project, which can be found here: https://github.com/harvitronix/reinforcement-learning-car

Think of this project as an extension of that one.

More information about running this project will be available soon.



## Credits

I'm grateful to the following people and the work they did that helped me learn how to do this:

- Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf
- Deep learning to play Atari games: https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl
- Another deep learning project for video games: https://github.com/asrivat1/DeepLearningVideoGames
- A great tutorial on reinforcement learning that a lot of my project is based on: http://outlace.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Part-3/
